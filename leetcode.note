single number
a^a = 0

single number 2
pattern:
every number appears three times means for every bit(0th, 1st, 2nd), sum the nth bit of every element of array, the result is multiple of 3.

permutations
1. dfs
2. swap

reverse integer
1. overflow
reverse 1000000009 or 2147483647(10 bits integer) will overflow
2. no need to use vector
using %10,/10 method, will get numbers in reverse order
3. x86_64(Ubuntu)
sizeof(int):      4
sizeof(long):     8
sizeof(long long):8
