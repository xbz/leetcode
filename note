#single-number
remove appears twice number
1. %2
2. bitwise exclusive or operator(^)

#single-number-ii
remove appears 3 times number
1. %3
if using modulus operator(%), single-number and single-number-ii are same problem

#single-number-iii
every numbers occurs twice except two(x, y)
^ all number, get x^y
find mask: the first different bit of x,y
divide array into 2 groups using mask, every group change to single-number problem
